### Description

This SW allows you to create complex SQL sentences, working with the Dictionary of the Data Base in use. This sentences can be saved to use it later.

IMPORTANT:

This SW was made in Spanish. As I drop the source code, change it to English is easy.

Advances:

-Works like the ISQL command.

-You can select the number of records to be recalled, and the timeout.

-The response will be separated by ASCII 9. Pass it to an Excel Worksheet to work with the results.

-You can create the masks for: insert, select, update, delete of the tables.

-You have a create table/index template.

-The sentence can be converted to a string to pass it trough the clipboard onto your VB project.

-You have an internal buffer, to work with two 'clipboards'.
 
### More Info
 
-You will need the properly ODBC drivers installed.

-The sele.ini file MUST be on the sele executable file.

None.
